# inquirer-rs

This is (the beginnings of) a Rust port of [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

At the moment, this is a very rough prototype, and probably shouldn't be used for anything
critical. It has only been tested on Linux, and only supports the `list` menu. Hopefully,
I'll be able to add more features soon, as well as perform some much needed refactoring.
